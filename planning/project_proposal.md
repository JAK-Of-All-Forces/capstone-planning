# Project Proposal

Pod Members: Amari May, Jessica Obi, and Kenna Nyuga-Galega

## Problem Statement

Insert your groups problem statement and target audience
We recognize that music listeners and lovers do not have a single condensed space to discuss their opinions or experience on the music they listen to, they have to traverse through multiple niche apps to find their community. So, we wanted to make this app to fix that. Our target audience is all music listeners who want to make it easy to find their communities.

## Related Work

What similar apps and websites? How will your project stand out from these other websites?

Some similar apps and websites are Instagram, Twitter, and Genius. Our project will stand out from these as a social media platform because it will be personally, by connecting users' Spotify accounts and utilize AI to personalize their feed based on what they listen to. It will be a place for active discussion on music on one app.
