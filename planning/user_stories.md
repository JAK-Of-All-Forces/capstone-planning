## Problem Statement

Music lovers often move through a variety of activities throughout their day, from studying to commuting to hiking or working out. However, the playlists they use for those activities are usually built manually by the user themselves or other music lovers. This process can be tedious, especially when someone wants a playlist that fits both their personal taste and the vibe and/or duration of their activity.

## User Personas

Jonathan is an avid Nicki Minaj fan who is living in Queens, New York, New York. He has been listening to Nicki since her rise in the early 2010s, and has recognized that he mainly likes to listen to songs that either have her Roman alter ego, or have a strong beat- songs that are less melodic. Many fan created playlists do not fit this curated and unique interest, so her would like to make a playlist that consists of such songs.

Bugsby is an opera singer and major fan of the opera genre from Berlin, Germany. As a black opera singer, she is a minority within the opera scene. She wants to get a stronger understanding of the musical stylistic choices of modern opera singers that are still inspired by the current opera songs she listens to.

Kelis works as an intern for Salesforce in San Francisco, her commute to work is about 20 minutes 10 filled with walking and the other ten filled with waiting on a packed bus. In the mornings she loves listening to R&B music, however her spotify playlist covers a variety of genres so she spends half of her commute skipping songs rather than enjoying her playlist. Because she’s so busy with her work as an intern she doesn't have time to curate her own morning playlist, and she’s already tried looking some up on spotify and the ones recommended have songs she doesn’t like.
